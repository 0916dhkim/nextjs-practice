## What is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)?
"Next.js" is a server-side-rendering framework that allows
developers to write React web application easily.
- `ReactDOM.render()` is not required, because "Next.js" renders
React components on server-side.
- "Next.js" provides very similar experience as PHP development.
Page routing is automatically handled by the framework, and
developers only need to place their files according to
the convention. This pattern is called **convention over configuration**
and it provides rigid & easy-to-navigate project structure while
lacking flexibility compared to other tools like webpack.
- "Next.js" apps are easy to deploy, because they are just static files
after compilation is complete.
